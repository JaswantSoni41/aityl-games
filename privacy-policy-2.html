                  We receive some information automatically when you use our Apps.
                  This includes data about your device, software, operating system,

                  advertisement tracking (“Advertising IDs”) and your IP address.

                  We do not collect personally identifiable information about you or

                  Occasionally we collect the personal information that you
                  voluntarily provide to us (e.g. email addresses you give us when
                  you submit a request to a support via our web or email). <br />
                  When you make in-app purchases in the our Games, we do not collect

                  information is collected and stored by your platform (Android's
                  Google Play) or your platform's payment processor.

                <p class="third-party-collection small-paragraph">
                  We collect this Information to improve performance and reliability
                  of our Games and to get a better understanding of what users in
                  general prefer. We do not link any of this Information in any way
                  to individuals or any other information we might obtain. We do not
                  share, sell or in any other way give other persons or companies.
                  We don't rent or sell your email address. <br />Our mobile
                  applications comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
                  Act (“COPPA”). In the event that a user identifies himself/herself
                  as a child under the age of 13 through a support request or
                  feedback, we will not collect, store or use and will delete in a
                  secure manner any personal information of such a user. <br />We
                  take care of filtering categories of sensitive and unsuitable ads
                  for children. But rarely can an advertiser misclassify your ads,
                  and this situation is beyond our reach.
